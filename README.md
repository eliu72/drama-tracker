## Get the Database Template
1. Create a personal Notion Integration (Step 1 only): https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started
2. Create a new page > pick the database (table) template
3. Share your new database with your new Notion integration (upper right corner)
4. Apply the template by going to this link: https://drama-tracker.herokuapp.com/create-database?notion_key=<YOUR NOTION KEY>&database_title=<YOUR DATABASE TITLE>

## Start Populating Your Table!
1. Add a new Movie/TV show title in the first column. You must also specify the Content Type. [Optional] You can also include the release year for specificity.
2. Sync up Notion: https://drama-tracker.herokuapp.com/api?notion_key=<YOUR NOTION KEY>&database_title=<YOUR DATABASE TITLE> to automatically get all details! 

## Notes
- I recommend putting the sync-up link in your database description for easy access
- You can add multiple titles and sync them all up at once
